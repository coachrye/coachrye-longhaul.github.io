## A Quick History

Did you know that Product Management started way back in the [early 1930s](https://www.mindtheproduct.com/history-evolution-product-management/)? IKR. I just found out about this too. Thank you, Google. Those in the [Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fastmoving-consumer-goods-fmcg.asp) industry might be more familiar with the term Brand Management which was its origin. It was only in the 1990s when technology advanced and the gaps between engineering and brand management widened. This is when product managers and product leaders were brought in to bridge the gap between teams.

I don’t know exactly when the role came to the Philippines but, personally, I only found out about it about a decade ago. The term sort of evolved from Business Analyst to Product Owner to Product Manager. Now I’m sure there are a lot of intricacies about these terms so I won’t even get into that. That’s simply how I experienced and got to know about it.

## Enough Product Management History

The point is product management is still in its infancy in the Philippines. Yes, we are starting to develop better products, but we are still way behind with the rest of the world and, even, our ASEAN friends.

This is exactly why two brilliant* Product Managers, Dino and JD, decided to launch Product Camp. They want to **help Filipinos adapt to the digital world** and **empower us to build and manage meaningful tech products**. This is not just your generic product management workshop, they have localized the contents and examples to make it more significant to the participants.

**I might seem biased here since Dino and JD are my co-hosts in Around the Bonfire but that simply means I have worked with them a lot and recognize that they really know their stuff.*

## Why should I care about Product Management?
There are plenty of reasons but let me just quote this report for you:

> It’s a good time to be in product. Salaries are 3x higher than the U.S. mean average, and over 55% of respondents say they’re hiring in the next six months. Whether staying put or making a move, PM’s can feel confident in job security and bright prospects ahead–not something everyone can count on in the wake of 2020.
