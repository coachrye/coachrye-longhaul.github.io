This is my negative self talking. This is my insecurities getting the best of me.

All those years in university wasted when I decided to shift to software development.

That time learning coding again wasted when I decided to move into software testing.

Climbed the corporate ladder until, you guessed it, wasted it all again by shifting to consulting, training and coaching.

## Wasted Time. Wasted Talent.

Now… trying to get myself back into tech and, yes, these negative talk and insecurities are getting louder and louder.

Why did I have to try all these? Did I really want to try the new or was I just quitting on the old?

Was I being brave and courageous when I went into entrepreneurship? Or was I simply being selfish?

Was all that time really wasted?

The funny thing is that I already have answers to these questions. I really do.

I had to try them because that was the only way to know if it is for me. It would have been worst always thinking about the what-ifs and what-could-have-beens.

I would neither call myself brave nor courageous, but I don’t think I was selfish either. I made the decision with my loved ones and we knew what we were getting into.

No, it was not a total waste. There were life lessons that I, heck we, could never have learned if we had not tried these at all.

## Everyone has their bad days.

Despite knowing the answer… there will really be days when the noises get so loud that I doubt myself too.

So, if you have been through these days, know that it is OK.

It’s OK if you want to plough through it.

It’s OK if you need to call for help.

It’s OK if you have to sit back and pause.

Once you are ready… get back on your feet because all those experiences (and failures) were not a waste.

They will help you push through and become the Master Of Yourself.
