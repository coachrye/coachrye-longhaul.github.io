There will never be a time when criticism will be better than positivity. Many people experience challenges, and criticism can only sink them more. [Words of encouragement for people stuck in tough situations](https://pigeonly.com/pigeonly-blog/words-of-encouragement-for-someone-in-jail/) enlighten their lives even more.

Positive words of encouragement cultivate feelings of teamwork, camaraderie, and more. Here are seven ways encouragement impacts people who give and receive them.

## 1. Boosts Confidence

One of the core reasons many people get hyped up about big events in life is that they know that they will be in a positive environment. Whether it’s a school performance, sports match, or wedding, people want to feel confident about themselves and their abilities. Positive words offer the same euphoria.

A boost in confidence can be life-changing. A nervous athlete can practice their moves until they are comfortable performing them in front of others. And a person who has always had low self-esteem can believe in themselves enough to leave an unhealthy relationship.

When a friend or peer receives positive reinforcement or approval, their confidence will soar. They will take realistic steps to improve their situation and work harder. Without positive feedback, people might feel demoralized and alone. 

## 2. Improves Morale 

A problem that businesses sometimes struggle with is how to motivate their employees to work better together. With only so much pay, it might seem that there isn’t anything to keep workers motivated and happy. 

However, encouraging team members can boost morale within the company. Small teams can get on the same page for a common goal when working together. Team members can critique each other’s work, and employees can give each other pep talks.

Some employees, students, and individuals give up too quickly. Allowing them to perceive that they still have a fighting chance could incite an urgent desire within them to push forward. Positive words help reaffirm a person’s desire to be their best.

## 3. Encouragement Inspires Others 

Sometimes, people don’t realize their words could motivate and inspire others. A kind word here and there can inspire others to work hard and achieve goals. And hearing those words can encourage people to try harder. 

For example, struggling students could work harder when they find out their teacher believes in them. Students trying to win against the competition can get fired up and play their best. A business worker can discover untapped motivation from an encouraging boss.

Most people who have helped others through a challenging time will tell you that it gave them more happiness than they received. A genuine, heartfelt compliment or true statement can have a tangible impact on someone else much more than we might imagine. 

By offering uplifting words and compliments to others, we can inspire them to write the next chapter in their own story. 

## 4. Makes Disabilities A Little Easier

A disability can be cruel. Many things can go wrong with the human body, even at birth. When one is born with a disability, life can be incredibly challenging. The physical handicap can be frustrating and discouraging.  

Most of the time, children who face physical or mental challenges will have family members who care for them. Disability is a major challenge, and the simplest living tasks can become major obstacles. Fortunately, families affected by disabilities can rely on their friends and family for support.  

The encouragement and support from loved ones can help a child with their condition have more confidence. They can better understand their situation and feel comfortable in their own skin.

## 5. Words of Comfort Help Heal 
Being a good friend, sister, mother, wife, and coworker is essential. People need attention, and when they can’t receive it from their loved ones, they might spiral out of control. 

For other people, words of affirmation are a daily struggle. They might battle depression, anxiety, or other mental/physical illnesses. Mental and physical ailments can take away from a person’s daily joy. 

A loved one dealing with a crisis or serious issues can quickly feel their emotions exhausted. Having a support system to get through tough times brings comfort to people. It can encourage them to heal emotionally and move forward with the life that they love.

## 6. Kindness Makes People Happier 

It’s a natural human instinct to offer kind words, and when someone is given a heartfelt compliment, they will return that generosity. 

A kind word can encourage or inspire a listener. It can show that the person offering the praise cares about them and is in a supportive mood. An optimist will see these words as a chance to cheer up their day. 

A word of kindness can uplift a dejected friend and initiate a conversation with a stranger. A mother having a bad day can take solace because her child took 10 minutes to listen and ask her how she was feeling. 

Giving out compliments and expressions of gratitude is an easy, free way to brighten another person’s day. 

## 7. Amplifies Empathy 

What happens when you’re stressed and overwhelmed? If you’re like most people, you start to feel like you’re drowning in your problems. You live paycheck to paycheck, and you have no idea how you will pay off your student loans, bills, and childcare costs.  

Your friend tells you about a problem they are experiencing, and you quickly find a way to relate. After listening to them talk it through, they express their gratitude for your empathy. You thank them for sharing their burdens and find a way to make their situation a little lighter. 

## The Bottom Line
Encouraging and supportive words are always appreciated. From giving one sincere, heart-felt comment to a stranger to supporting a loved one in a wheelchair, caring, loving, and cheering for others is infectious.  

Developing an empathetic nature is a quality that can help people from all walks of life. In an age where it’s easy to get lost in the shuffle, it is vital to have someone there to provide a shoulder to cry on. These positive impacts of encouragement make it much better than needless criticism.
