The Golden Rule

> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Sounds great, but I’d like to suggest something else.

> Do unto others as that they want done unto them.

Yes, it is still a one-liner and it does still seem too simple, but think about how hard it will be to actually do this. We have to take into account others’ uniqueness and accept that what we want may not necessarily be what others want. In fact, they might loathe or find it offensive.

This means

1. getting out of our comfort zone
1. talking to people and asking them what they reall want
1. building a good and open relationship with others, so they will be open

Yes, this will require more from us than the Golden Rule, but in the end, I believe the benefits to our relationship will be worth it.

## What do you think?

What do you think about this “minor” change? 😜 Let me know your thoughts.

```Unquotable Quotes is a series that highlights Quotes and Beliefs that often make life too simplistic. Life is too complex for its lessons to be wrapped up in a few lines, let alone one-liners.```
