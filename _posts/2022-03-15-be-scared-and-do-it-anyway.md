## Bonjour from Canada! 🇨🇦

Wow! That was quick. We couldn’t believe that it’s already been 2 1⁄2 months since we arrived in Toronto with our luggages. Three months since the visa approval. Yes, just 2 weeks to get everything sorted out, from getting our passports stamped, buying our plane tickets, and selling off our last remaining possessions to make sure everything fitted into those four luggages.

## Uncertainties and Hesitation

The pace was not always this quick. I was employing a lot of “delaying tactics” at the start of the process. It took me a while to request for documents, get our finances settled, and to set that passport renewal appointment scheduled.

I mean, I knew we had lots of good reasons why this was the right move at this time.

- Alaine wanted to further her culinary skills and a degree from a reputable Canadian university will be great for her career.
- There was not much going on in the Philippines anyway. Yes, I was still busy with my startup and some other projects I was working on but, by that time, we’d been stuck at home for more than a year already.
- I found out I had friends in the very city that Alaine’s school was in. For those who know me well, you know how important this is to me and my #Relator talent theme.

So, again, yes, I knew these reasons were good but there were just so many uncertainties.

## Be Scared And Do It Anyway!

I started repeating some of the things I’ve heard myself tell my friends before

- No harm in trying!
- Just Do It!
- Be Scared And Do It Anyway!

Sometimes Quotable Quotes help. This was NOT one of those times. 😅

## What’s The Worst That Can Happen?

Instead, this was the question that helped me get over the uncertainties. I contemplated a lot on this. What are the worst things that could happen if we push through?

### I may not get a job in the industry I want

It’s been half-a-decade since I last worked for a tech company. Since then, most of my time was spent in coaching and training. Yes, I have my tech startup but it seems like a far-cry from my days with multinational tech companies.

*There’s a huge probability that may happen but, you know what, that’s fine. I can take on other types of work. My friends assured me that there are tons of opportunities here as long as I am not picky. Some of them doubt that I’ll be able to survive some type of work though, especially customer-facing ones. 😅 I can’t blame them, they know me! But, you know what, I know me too. I always find a way to learn and make things happen. No matter what.*

### We may NOT like it here

I’ve heard and read a lot of good things about Canada and the people here. But, I’ve also heard of not so good stories. I’ve heard of families who decided to move back months after landing, of people not able to blend in and feeling totally isolated.

*If that will be the case, then so be it. We survived more than a year in lockdown, what’s a couple more, albeit colder. Just work like crazy and save like Zooey, so the stopover would be worth it. If it gets too lonely, there’s always Zoom with family and friends.*

### They may NOT like us here

We may end up liking it here but may not be granted a permanent residency. I’ve also heard of these stories, of foreign workers forced to head back home because they could not get the proper permits.

*I guess we just live the next few years as if we don’t like it here and save, save, save. Besides, at the end of two years Alaine would have earned her degree and, just that, would be all worth it.*

## Expect The Worst, Hope For The Best

There is still a chance that all these worst-case scenarios might happen (*[I am trying my best not to let #1 happen](/blog/agile-mba-with-the-job-hackers/) but who knows, right?*) and that’s OK. It’s OK to be scared, just do it anyway.

### Be safe and be strong!

P.S. I want to use this time to thank the wonderful people who played crucial roles in our move to and our stay in Canada. As courageous as we have been, we would not have been able to get through this as smoothly without them.

**The DCI Connection:** Anna Fe and Darwin. Friends from my first job, back in the Development Bank of the Philippines, over two decades ago. For taking us in, literally, like family and easing the transition.

**The Ateneo Connection:** Arman, Gino and Cocoy. College friends who took time away from their busy schedule to meet with us and welcome us to Canada, sharing useful and practical tips from their experience, as well as constant words of encouragement.

**The YFC Connection:** Jeo. A friend from three decades ago who I recently reconnected with. Thank you for the great conversations and for the housewarming gift. Photos to follow 😉

**Our Families:** Kuya, Joie, Ate Ann and Ate Jinx. Papa, Mama, Tita Alma and Tito Dong. For always supporting all our decisions, even when it was also a surprise to you. 🥰

Yes, this post is about being scared and doing it anyway… but it does help to have **amazing people** around you.
