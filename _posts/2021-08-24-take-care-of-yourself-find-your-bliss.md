It is NOT selfish to take care of yourself first.

In fact, in this pandemic, doing so is a way of caring for your loved ones too. As a colleague said, *“taking care of yourself means one less person that your family and friends need to worry about.”*

But how does one care for yourself these days?

Here are my quick thoughts.

## Body

Our movements are limited. For us in the Philippines, we are still under lockdown. We have to watch our diet and lifestyle.

- How are you taking care of our physical body?
- Without your usual sports activities, what are you doing to exercise?
- What are you fueling your body with?

## Learning

Learning does not have to be something practical. It is about keeping our mind occupied.

- How are you taking care of your mind?
- What new thing are you learning? Skill, knowledge or, maybe something fun, like a craft, a hobby or a game?

## Investment

It’s a very unstable time in the market, and worries and anxieties about the stability of our income can be unsettling.

- How are you taking care of your finances?
- How are you making sure that your income > expenses?

## Social

We are social beings. Some are better at staying at home and being by themselves, but we all need other people. In fact, I read somewhere that introverts are having a worst time in this pandemic.

- How are you maintaining your relationship with other people?
- What are you doing to have that regular contact with loved ones?
- What are you doing to have a different mix of people in your life? Apart from the immediate family you live with.

## Spiritual or Sense of Purpose

A lot are struggling to find meaning amid all this chaos

- What are you doing to have peace of mind?
- If you believe in a higher being, how are you keeping that relationship?

## Find your BLISS

Hopefully this helps you in take care of your self and push you towards your journey to WELLNESS.
