Weâ€™re still working on the details of the podcast but Iâ€™m really excited about this.

Excited because Iâ€™m sure I will be learning a lot from it.

Iâ€™ve teamed up with experts who want to level-up the Startup and tech community in the Philippines, by sharing their experience and talent.

Weâ€™ll probably talk about the business of startup too.

Weâ€™ll definitely have some geek talk with software developers and architects.
Weâ€™ll surely pick the brains of Startup founders and leaders.
We will tackle all these things and more.

Trust me, if you are curious about startups and technology, or about entrepreneurship in general, then you really have to subscribe to this podcast.

More details coming soon!

I know. I know. Iâ€™m being sort of a tease here but, like I said, I really donâ€™t have all the details yet.

Stay tuned.ðŸ˜‰
