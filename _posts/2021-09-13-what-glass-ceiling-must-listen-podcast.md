I first listened to the What Glass Ceiling Podcast last week when the episode with [Mikee Cojuangco-Jaworski](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7df1buHm5LCk5Ky8QgyZeS?si=ezFgVI9gT3KG4UwaiiriXg&dl_branch=1) came out. One episode, thatâ€™s all it took. I was hooked. This has to be one of the most insightful podcasts Iâ€™ve ever subscribed to. I binged-listened (?) all 12 episodes of season 2 in two days!

For those not familiar with podcastsâ€¦

So you can do chores, exercise, some even work while listening! It&#39;s free to listen to episodes on platforms such as Spotify.</p>&mdash; Bianca Gonzalez (@iamsuperbianca) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamsuperbianca/status/1431616806385455105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

*Commercial break: Our podcast, [Around The Bonfire](/blog/around-the-bonfire-podcast-is-now-live/), is pretty insightful too ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰*

## What is What Glass Ceiling all about?

In What Glass Ceiling, [Lia Cruz](https://twitter.com/liadcruz) has real conversations with inspiring women about their journeys â€” the struggles, the doubts, the joys, and all the glass ceilings that must be shattered along the way.

For guys reading this, no this podcast is not just for women, it is for us too.

As Lia and [Reese Fernandez-Ruiz](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6dbAFifdkKkkL54DvjnGKw?si=tfgScSNBRrqJ9tTWiS6naQ&dl_branch=1) mentioned, we play an instrumental role in furthering the cause and experience of women. We have to stand up for them when we can. Itâ€™s not that they are weak, of course not. Itâ€™s about us being aware of what they are going through so that we can speak and stand up for them when they need it. Especially when they are too shocked to react. Listen to the [Natashya Gutierrez](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0nAlVvLj2AwhVXHtTmnUx3?si=QXpIh_GHQCWxvnyH2lhZDg&dl_branch=1) episode and you will know what Iâ€™m talking about.

## Not About Being a Hero

Just to be clear, this is not about being a hero. This is simply about being a decent human being.

Now, this comes somewhat naturally for me. You see, I have always believed in the power of women and thatâ€™s because Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to always be surrounded by strong-willed women my entire life. From my mom and my two older sisters, to my classmates from elementary all the way to college, and of course my lovely wife. Not only that, I was surrounded by men who treated women with the highest of regards, starting with my dad.

Despite this, I cannot really say that I have always acted in such a way that I further the cause and experience of women. No, not always. I still have weak moments. Thereâ€™s so much machismo crap out there convincing us otherwise that itâ€™s hard not to always be decent.

But I am trying. I am trying my best. The stories from What Glass Ceiling helps reminds us that we all need to keep trying. So that, hopefully, one day there will be no glass ceilings.
