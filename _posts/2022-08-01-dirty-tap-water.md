Turning that dirty tap back on is not easy though. It can be tough and sticky, but we have to power through it.

## Consistency is the Key

Whether it’s writing, vlogging or singing, it’s important that you keep creating and honing your craft. You don’t have to put everything out there, but you just have to keep working on it — even in private.

Get a mentor or a group of friends to review your creation. Get those who are honest enough to give you constructive feedback — feedback that can help you get better.

Keep working. Keep improving.

Eventually that shit water will become cleaner and cleaner.

## Shit Water Coming

Don’t wait for it to be perfectly clean before letting them out though. At some point, you have to let it out and let it go.

Time to open up that dirty tap. Let’s go.
